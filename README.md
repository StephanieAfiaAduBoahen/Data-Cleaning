### PURPOSE OF PROJECT
During this project, I investigated other SQL functions and application and worked on data cleaning techniques. I had the opportunity to study and experiment with several SQL functions, including PARSENAME and SUBSTRING. I looked into how to: Rename and alter tables.
1.	Update tables. 
2.	Remove duplicates in the dataset.
3.	Combine two or more columns.
4.	Break out one column into two.
5.	Change data types. 
6.	Add a temp table.
